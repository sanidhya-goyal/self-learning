## OSI Model: The 7 Layers of Networking

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model breaks down network communication into 7 conceptual layers:

1. **Application Layer** – Interfaces directly with end-user applications (e.g., browsers, email).
2. **Presentation Layer** – Translates, encrypts, or compresses data (e.g., JPEG, SSL).
3. **Session Layer** – Manages sessions or connections (start, maintain, end).
4. **Transport Layer** – Ensures reliable delivery of data (TCP/UDP).
5. **Network Layer** – Handles routing and addressing (IP).
6. **Data Link Layer** – Manages node-to-node communication (MAC addresses).
7. **Physical Layer** – Transmits raw bits over physical medium (cables, signals).

### Focus Layers for Developers
- **Application Layer**
- **Transport Layer**

## 1. Application Layer

The topmost layer directly interacts with user-facing software.

### 1.1 Client-Server Protocols

Used in centralized communication models where clients request and servers respond.

#### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- Connection Oriented
- Stateless and text-based.
- **1 TCP connection**.
- Not secure; replaced by **HTTPS** (adds encryption via TLS).

#### FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- Used for transferring files.
- **2 TCP connections**:
    - **Control connection** – for commands. (always stays connected)
    - **Data connection** – for file transfer. (Can stay connected or disconnect, also the files/data shared are not secured)
- Not secure; often replaced by **SFTP** or **HTTPS**.

#### SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- Used to **send** emails.
- Works with:
    - **IMAP** – Reads emails directly from the server (synchronization).
    - **POP3** – Downloads and deletes mail from the server (older approach).
- IMAP is now preferred due to multi-device support.

#### WebSockets
- Peer to Peer
- Provides **bi-directional** full-duplex communication.
- Useful for real-time apps like messaging, games.
- Maintains a **persistent connection** between client and server.

##### WebSocket Architecture

- **Client 1 ⇄ Server**
- **Client 2 ⇄ Server**
- No direct communication between clients.
- Server acts as the relay between clients.

e.g. Chat based system - WhatsApp, Telegram

### 1.2 Peer-to-Peer Protocols

In decentralized systems, each participant (peer) can act as both client and server.

#### WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)
- Enables direct **peer-to-peer** communication.
- Used in real-time video/audio calling, P2P file sharing.
- Supports **bi-directional connections**:
    - **Client 1 ⇄ Client 2**
    - **Client 1 ⇄ Server** (for signaling)
    - **Client 2 ⇄ Server** (for signaling)
- The server is only used for setting up the connection, not for media transfer.

## 2. Transport Layer / Network Layer

These layers are responsible for data delivery across networks.

### 2.1 TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)

- **Connection-oriented** (establishes a virtual connection for data packets transmission).
- Ensures:
    - **Reliable delivery** (packet acknowledgment).
    - **Ordered data** (sequence numbers).
    - **Error checking**.
- Used in applications like HTTP(S), FTP, email.

### 2.2 UDP/IP (User Datagram Protocol / Internet Protocol)

- **Connectionless** and faster than TCP.
- Sends **datagrams** without guarantees:
    - No delivery acknowledgment.
    - No guaranteed ordering.
- Ideal for real-time apps:
    - **Live streaming**
    - **Online gaming**
    - **Voice/video calls**
- **WebRTC** relies on UDP for low-latency communication.
