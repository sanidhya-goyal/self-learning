# SQL vs NoSQL

---

## Overview

SQL can be divided into 4 quadrants:

```

    Structure      |    Nature           
+------------------+------------------+
    Scalability    |    Property         

```

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

- SQL is used to manage data in RDBMS (Relational Database Management System).
- It uses structured schemas, tables, and relationships to organize data.

### 1. Structure
- Data is stored in **tables** with **rows and columns**.
- Schema is **predefined**.
- There are **relations** between tables.

### 2. Nature
- For generic use cases, a **single server** holds multiple (possibly normalized) tables.
- The data is **centralized**.

### 3. Scalability
- **Vertical scaling**: Increase RAM, CPU of a single machine.
- **Horizontal scaling**: Possible using **sharding**, but not as natively supported or efficient as NoSQL.

### 4. Property
- **ACID** properties:
  - **Atomicity**
  - **Consistency**
  - **Isolation**
  - **Durability**
- Ensures **data integrity** and **consistency**.

## NoSQL (Non-relational / Not Only SQL)

### 1. Structure

NoSQL supports unstructured or semi-structured data and comes in several types:

#### a. Key-Value Store
- Data stored as **key → value**.
- Value is opaque; cannot be queried.
- Example: **DynamoDB**

#### b. Document DB
- Key → JSON/XML document
- **Can query both key and value**.
- Example: **MongoDB**

#### c. Column-wise DB
- Key → set of column-value pairs
- Different keys may have different columns.

Example:
```
                Column          Value
10001  -> 	first name	:	Shryanash
		dept		:	IT
		Interest	:	BasketBall

                Column                  Value
10002  -> 	first name	:	Raj
                dept		:	Sales
```

#### d. Graph DB
- Data stored as **nodes and edges**.
- Suitable for **social networks** and **recommendation engines**.
- Example: Node: Shrayansh → Friend of → Xyzzy

### 2. Nature
- **Decentralized / Distributed** architecture

### 3. Scalability
- **Horizontal scaling** is native and easy to implement.

### 4. Property
- **BASE** properties:
- **Basically Available** (Highly Available with replicas, as explained in "Design Key value")
- **Soft State** State of the data can be changed without interaction (Vector clock and syncing with each other of replicas)
- **Eventually Consistent**


- Data is highly available across distributed nodes.
- Updates may take time to reflect across nodes (eventual consistency).

## When to Use SQL vs NoSQL - by Shrayansh

| Use Case                             | SQL                                   | NoSQL                                   |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Flexible query functionality        | ✅ Supports complex joins and queries  | ❌ Limited and predefined queries         |
| Relational or hierarchical data     | ✅ Strong support                      | ❌ Not ideal for deeply related data      |
| Strong data integrity & consistency | ✅ ACID compliant                      | ❌ May return stale/inconsistent data     |
| High availability & scalability     | ❌ Harder to scale                     | ✅ Natively distributed and highly available |
