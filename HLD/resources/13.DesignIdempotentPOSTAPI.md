# Design Idempotent POST API | Handle Duplicate Requests by Idempotency Handler

## Key Concepts

There are two primary concerns in this topic:

1. **Concurrency** – Multiple users accessing the same resource simultaneously.
    - Example: Movie ticket booking, race conditions.

2. **Idempotency** – To take care of duplicate requests\
Safely retrying operations without unintended side effects.
    - Prevents duplicate operations due to retries.
    - Ensures operations like "Add to cart" or "Make payment" are safe to retry.

## Default HTTP Idempotency

By default, GET PUT and DELETE are idempotent in nature while POST is not.

| Method | Idempotent by Default | Notes |
|--------|------------------------|-------|
| GET    | ✅                     | Safe to retry, no side effects |
| PUT    | ✅                     | Replaces existing resource, no duplicates |
| DELETE | ✅                     | Deletes resource, repeat has no further effect |
| POST   | ❌                     | Creates resource, needs explicit handling to avoid duplicates |

## Duplicate POST Requests

### 1. Sequential Duplicate

- Client sends POST request.
- Server processes it but client times out.
- Client retries the same request → **Duplicate processing risk**.

### 2. Parallel Duplicate

- Client sends the same request multiple times (e.g. from different tabs or devices).
- Requests may hit different servers → **Duplicate risk in distributed systems**.

---

## Idempotency Handling Using Idempotency Key

### Key Principle

- Use a **unique key (UUID)** per operation from the client.

### Agreements with Client

1. Client must generate a unique **idempotency key** for each operation.
2. Key must be sent with each request (typically in a header).

---

## Flow: Idempotent POST Request

1. **Client generates** a unique idempotency key.
2. **Client sends** POST request with key in HTTP header.
3. **Server validates**:
    - If key missing → Return `HTTP 400 Bad Request`.
4. **Server checks DB/cache** for the key:
    - **Key not present**:
        - Create DB entry:
            - Status = `created`
        - Proceed to process the request.
    - **Key present**:
        - Status = `created` → Another request is in progress → Return `HTTP 409 Conflict`.
        - Status = `consumed` → Request already processed → Return `HTTP 200 OK`.

5. On successful completion:
    - Update key status to `consumed`.
    - Return appropriate success response (`HTTP 201 Created`).

## Lifecycle of an Idempotency Key

- `created` → Operation started
- `consumed` → Operation successfully completed

---

## Handling Parallel Requests

#### Problem

Two POST requests with the same key arrive at the same time.

#### Solution

- Use **mutex/semaphore locks** at Step 4 to ensure only one request processes the key at a time.

---

### Distributed System Handling

#### Problem

Duplicate requests with same key arrive at different servers.

#### Solution

- Use **distributed cache (e.g., Redis)** to manage idempotency key state.
    - Cache is faster to synchronize than DB.
    - Perform locking and status tracking in cache.
    - Use TTL to auto-expire stale keys if needed.

## HTTP Status Codes Summary

| Scenario                             | HTTP Status | Meaning |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|---------|
| Idempotency key missing              | 400         | Bad Request |
| New key, request accepted            | 201         | Created |
| Key found, status = `consumed`       | 200         | Already processed |
| Key found, status = `created`        | 409         | Conflict – request in progress |
