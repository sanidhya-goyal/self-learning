# Proxy vs Reverse Proxy

## What is a Proxy Server?

A **Proxy Server** acts as an intermediary between a client and the destination server.  
It handles requests on behalf of the client.

```
Client ---> Proxy Server ---> Server
```


- A single proxy server can serve multiple clients.
- Primarily used for **anonymity**, **filtering**, **logging**, **caching**, and **security**.

## Types of Proxy

### 1. Forward Proxy



**Architecture:**

```
Client (Intranet / Closed Network) --> Forward Proxy --> Internet --> Server
```

- Sits **in front of the client**
- Hides client identity from the server
- Proxy has its **own public IP**, exposed to the outside world

**Advantages:**
1. **Anonymity** – hides client IPs
2. **Access control** – define what content clients can access
3. **Geo-access** – access geo-restricted content by proxying from allowed regions
4. **Security** – filters and blocks unwanted requests
5. **Caching** – reduce bandwidth for repetitive content requests

**Disadvantages:**
- Operates at **application level**, so a separate proxy is needed per application

### 2. Reverse Proxy

**Architecture:**

```
Client --> Reverse Proxy --> Internal Servers
```

- Sits **in front of servers**
- Clients never communicate directly with the backend servers
- Handles **routing**, **security**, **caching**, and **load distribution**

**Advantages:**
1. **Server anonymity** – backend servers are hidden from public access
2. **DDoS prevention** – absorbs malicious traffic before it hits servers
3. **Caching** – improves performance for static content
4. **Reduced latency** – can be geo-distributed (like CDN)
5. **Load balancing** – distributes traffic among backend servers

## Comparisons

### Proxy vs VPN

- **Proxy** acts as a bypass for restricted content or anonymity.
    - Caching, logging, and IP masking.
- **VPN** creates a tunnel:
    - Client connects to VPN client → encrypts data → VPN server decrypts and sends to target.
    - Ensures privacy and encryption of entire traffic (not just application-specific like proxy).

---

### Proxy vs Load Balancer (or Reverse Proxy vs Load Balancer)

- **Proxy can be a load balancer**, but **load balancer is not necessarily a proxy**.
- Load balancing is just **one capability** of a proxy.
- **Load balancer is not required for single server**, but proxy can sit in front of even one server.

---

### Proxy vs Firewall

- **Firewall** does **packet-level scanning** (headers, port numbers, source/destination IP).
    - Works at **network level**
- **Proxy** operates at **application level**:
    - Has access to request data
    - One proxy per application
- **Firewall** applies to all apps; **proxy** is app-specific
