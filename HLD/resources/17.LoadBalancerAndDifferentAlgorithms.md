# Load Balancers and Their Algorithms

## What is Load Balancing?

Load balancing refers to the process of distributing network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure:

- No single server is overwhelmed.
- Efficient utilization of resources.
- High availability and fault tolerance.

## Categories of Load Balancers

### 1. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

- Operates at **Layer 4** (Transport Layer) of the OSI Model.
- Makes routing decisions based on:
    - IP Address
    - TCP/UDP Ports
    - Source/Destination addresses

### 2. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

- Operates at **Layer 7** (Application Layer) of the OSI Model.
- Can inspect:
    - Headers
    - Cookies
    - Session information
    - Body content (Data)
- Supports features like:
    - Caching
    - Content-based routing

## Load Balancing Algorithms

### **Static Algorithms**

#### 1. Round Robin

- Requests are distributed sequentially across all servers.

**Advantages:**
- Simple to implement.
- Equal distribution.

**Disadvantages:**
- Ignores server capacity.
- All servers treated equally, even if their performance varies.

---

#### 2. Weighted Round Robin

- Assigns a weight to each server based on its capacity.
- Servers with higher weights get more requests.

**Example:**
- Server 1: Weight = 3
- Server 2: Weight = 1  
  → 3 requests to S1, 1 to S2, then repeat.

**Advantages:**
- Takes server capacity into account.
- Prevents overloading weaker servers.

**Disadvantages:**
- Does not consider request complexity or execution time.

---

#### 3. IP Hash

- Hash function applied on client’s IP to determine the target server.

**Advantages:**
- Ensures the same client goes to the same server.
- Useful for sticky sessions.

**Disadvantages:**
- Proxies can mask real IPs.
- Uneven distribution if many clients share the same IP (e.g. behind NAT/proxy).

---

### **Dynamic Algorithms**

#### 1. Least Connections

- Request goes to the server with the **least number of active connections**.

**Advantages:**
- Accounts for real-time server load.

**Disadvantages:**
- Some connections might be idle.
- Doesn’t distinguish between low/high capacity servers.

---

#### 2. Weighted Least Connections

- Each server has a weight (capacity indicator).
- Route request based on the **connection-to-weight ratio**.

**Example:**
- Server 1: 2 connections, weight 10 → 2/10 = 0.2
- Server 2: 1 connection, weight 1 → 1/1 = 1  
  → Choose Server 1

**Advantages:**
- More balanced for variable capacity servers.

**Disadvantages:**
- Still doesn't consider request complexity.

---

#### 3. Least Response Time

- Uses:
    - Each Server will have **Active Connections**
    - **Time To First Byte (TTFB)**: Time to receive first byte from server

**Selection Metric:**

```
Score = Active Connections × TTFB
Choose the server with the lowest score
```

**Example:**

| Server | Active Connections | TTFB | Score |
|--------|--------------------|------|-------|
| S1     | 3                  | 2    | 6     |
| S2     | 1                  | 4    | 4     |
| S3     | 2                  | 0    | 0     |

→ **S3** is selected.

**Advantages:**
- Considers real-time responsiveness.

**Disadvantages:**
- Needs continuous performance monitoring and metric updates.
