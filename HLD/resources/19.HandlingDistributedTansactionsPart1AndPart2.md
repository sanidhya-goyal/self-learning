# Handling Distributed Transactions

---

## What is a Transaction?

It refers to a set of operations which need to be performed or simply say group of tasks which need to be performed against the DB.

### ACID Properties:
- **Atomicity:**  : All operations in a single transaction should be success or all should fail.
- **Consistency** : DB should be in consistent state before and after the transaction
- **Isolation** : More than on transaction that is running concurrently, appears to be serialised.
- **Durability** : After transaction successfully completed, even if DB fails, data should not get lost.

### Example:
```
Begin Transaction:
   - Withdraw ₹100 from Account A
   - Deposit ₹100 to Account B
If all succeed:
   - Commit
Else:
   - Rollback
End Transaction
```

## Why Are Distributed Transactions Challenging?

In distributed systems, a single transaction may involve multiple services or databases (e.g., updating `Order DB` and `Inventory DB`). Since transactions are local to databases, achieving **ACID properties across multiple nodes** requires coordination.

## Strategies to Handle Distributed Transactions:

### 1. Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

A classic protocol to coordinate distributed transactions using a **Transaction Coordinator** and multiple **Participants**.

#### Phase 1: Prepare (Voting Phase)
- Coordinator sends a *prepare* request to all participants.
- Participants execute operations and respond:
    - **"Yes"**: Ready to commit (lock resources, but do not apply changes).
    - **"No"**: Abort required.

#### Phase 2: Commit / Abort
- If all participants vote **"Yes"**, coordinator sends *commit*.
- If any vote **"No"**, coordinator sends *abort*.

#### Logging:
Both the coordinator and participants maintain a persistent log of their state for recovery purposes.

#### Failure Scenarios:

1. Transaction Coordinator can fail
2. Participant can fail

- Prepare Message is lost (Coordinator Failed)
- OK message is lost (Participant Failed)
- Decision Message (Commit / Abort) is failed (Coordinator is failed)


### Case 1 When prepare message is lost
- The participant (e.g., Inventory) has locked the data. 
- It waits for a Prepare message from the coordinator. 
- If it doesn’t arrive within a timeout, the participant aborts the transaction. 
- If the Prepare comes after the timeout, the participant still replies with "No".

### Case 2 What if OK message is lost
- Coordinator sends the Prepare message. 
- Participant sends back OK, but it gets lost. 
- Coordinator times out and decides to abort the transaction. 
- Since the participant had locked the resource, it queries the coordinator for the final decision. 
- The coordinator checks its log and sends back the Abort.

### Case 3 What if the ‘Commit / Abort’ message is lost
- Phase 1 completed successfully and all participants sent OK.
- During Phase 2, the coordinator sends the final Commit or Abort, but the message is lost.
- The participant cannot take its own decision.
- It queries the coordinator for the decision.
- The coordinator checks its log and re-sends the final outcome.
- The participant can not take its own decision in 2 phase commit

To resolve this we have 3 phase

| Failure                                  | Mitigation |
|------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Prepare message lost**                 | Participant times out and aborts. |
| **OK response lost**                     | Coordinator times out and aborts. |
| **Commit/Abort lost (Decision message)** | Participant queries coordinator or other participants based on logs. |

#### Limitations:
- Blocking protocol: If the coordinator crashes during Phase 2, participants are left in doubt.
- Participants cannot decide independently in uncertain situations.
- Risk of **resource locks** being held indefinitely.

### 2. Three-Phase Commit (3PC)

An enhancement of 2PC that adds an intermediate **Pre-Commit Phase** to reduce blocking and uncertainty.

#### Phases:

1. **Prepare Phase**: Same as 2PC.
2. **Pre-Commit Phase**: Coordinator informs participants of intent to commit but does not enforce it yet.
3. **Commit Phase**: Coordinator sends commit confirmation. Participants execute commit.

Phase 3 will have the actual message of operation that needs to be done


So here by another layer of ‘prepare to commit’ message we had already given the info about the next operation that they need to do, even in case if the actual message ( phase 3 ) gets failed, the participants knows what needs to be done.

In case of prepare commit got failed ( or say in the log file there’s no entry for prepare to commit at the coordinator side ).

The participants knows about each other, they can query other participants that whether the other participants  have received anything from coordinator.

So they can simply abort ( assuming the coordinator failed to take a decision )\
When the coordinator comes up again and sees no entry for pre commit, the decision it will take is to abort and participants had already aborted.

#### Advantages:
- Participants are aware of the transaction's status before the final commit.
- Participants can coordinate among themselves in the event of coordinator failure.
- Reduces the risk of indefinite blocking.

#### Limitation:
- More complex than 2PC.
- Still assumes reliable communication and does not handle long-running business processes well.



> 2 PC and 3 PC are synchronous in nature

### 3. SAGA Pattern

A **decentralized, asynchronous** approach suited for long-lived transactions across multiple services.

#### Key Concepts:
- A transaction is broken down into a series of **local transactions**.
- Each local transaction has a corresponding **compensating action** to undo its effect if something fails downstream.

#### Execution Flow:
- T1 → T2 → T3 → T4 → T5
- If T5 fails, compensating transactions are invoked in reverse order:
    - T4′ → T3′ → T2′ → T1′

#### Implementation:
- Typically uses **event-driven architecture** with message queues.
- Services publish events upon completion or failure, which trigger compensations.

#### Advantages:
- Asynchronous and non-blocking.
- Works well in microservices with independent data stores.
- Scales better than 2PC/3PC for distributed, long-running transactions.

#### Trade-offs:
- Requires custom compensation logic.
- Doesn't provide strict ACID guarantees; follows **eventual consistency**.
- Complex error handling and rollback flows.

## Comparison Summary:

| Strategy     | Nature       | Blocking | Suitable For               | Consistency Level   |
|--------------|--------------|----------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| **2PC**       | Synchronous  | Yes      | Simple, short transactions | Strong (but blocking)|
| **3PC**       | Synchronous  | No       | Same as 2PC, with fault tolerance | Stronger than 2PC |
| **SAGA**      | Asynchronous | No       | Long-running, microservices | Eventual             |

### Best Practices:
- Use **SAGA** for user-facing, asynchronous workflows (e.g., e-commerce).
- Use **2PC/3PC** when strong consistency is absolutely required and latency is acceptable.
- Avoid distributed transactions if possible, design your system to reduce inter-service dependencies.
