# Divide Monolithic to Microservice

## Why we want microservice? 

1. Loosely coupled.
2. Code, test, deploy independently.
3. Less communication overhead.
4. Scale independently.

## How to divide?
### DDD Approach : Domain Driven Design 

1. First step : Understand the Domain
e.g. Chat application, E - commmerce

2. Come up with sub-domain : Event Storming approach
   1. Take out all the events. (e.g. for chat app - User is registered , user login, msg sent, msg delivered, msg deleted, etc.)
   2. Sequence it and try to find any missing event ( e.g. User login --> User logout / Message Sent 
   Message Sent --> Message Delivered / Message Received --> Message Deleted )
   3. Bounded Context : e.g. Sandwich in restaurant vs Sandwich in Garbage (Consider 2 separate boundaries for similar object)
   User ( register, login, logout ) -> User management boundary 
   Message (sent, delivered, deleted) -> Message can have certain meaning like who sent it?, content, status : pending / delivered / deleted --> message bounded context
   Notification  (user notified) -> notification event happening on "user", user here is not equivalent to user bounded context, User notified is different bounded context.
   4. Whatever object they are working, we can create a microservice for that,
   e.g. - User Microservice ( user bounded context), Message microservice (message bounded context) , notification microservice (notification bounded context)
   These bounded context are decided by "domain experts"
