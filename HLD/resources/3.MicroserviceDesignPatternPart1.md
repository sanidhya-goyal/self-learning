# Microservice Design Pattern Part 1

Introduction and Decomposition Pattern

## Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

### Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic application is built as a single, unified unit that contains all functionalities frontend, backend, business logic, and data access within one codebase.

**Advantages**
- Simpler to develop initially
- Easy to debug and test in early stages
- Fewer network calls (everything is local)

**Disadvantages**
- Overloaded IDE: All components in a single codebase can slow development tools
- Scalability issues: Scaling the entire app just for one functionality is inefficient
- Tightly coupled components: A change in one module can impact others
- Deployment challenges: Any code change (even a minor one) requires redeploying the entire application
- Difficult to adopt new technologies: Any technology update affects the whole system

### Microservices Architecture

A microservices architecture breaks down an application into small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is focused on a single business capability.

**Advantages**
- Modularity: Easier to manage and maintain
- Scalability: Individual services can scale independently
- Technology flexibility: Different services can use different stacks
- Faster deployments: Update only the service that changed

**Disadvantages**
- Service decomposition complexity: Improper division can lead to tight interdependencies
- Increased latency: Inter-service communication over the network can introduce delays
- Complex transaction management: Requires strategies like eventual consistency and saga patterns
- DevOps overhead: Requires infrastructure to manage service discovery, load balancing, monitoring, etc.

## Microservice Design Patterns & Phases

### 1. Decomposition Strategies

Decomposing a monolith into microservices is crucial and should be approached carefully.

#### A. By Functionalities / Capabilities

Example: An e-commerce platform
- Order Management
- Product / Inventory Management
- User Accounts
- Authentication / Login
- Billing & Payments

Each of these can be developed as independent services.

#### B. By Subdomains (Domain-Driven Design - DDD)

Break down by business domains and subdomains:

**Order Management Domain**
- Order Placement Service
- Order Tracking Service

**Payment Domain**
- Payment Processing (forward payment)
- Refund Handling (reverse payment)

This approach ensures better alignment with business logic and ownership.

### 2. Database Strategies

- **Single Database**: All services share one DB (less ideal for true microservices)
- **Database per Service**: Each microservice manages its own schema and database (preferred for autonomy and scalability)

---

### 3. Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: RESTful APIs, gRPC
- **Asynchronous**: Message queues, Event buses (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)

**Guidelines:**
- Use APIs when real-time interaction is needed
- Use Events for decoupling and eventual consistency

---

### 4. Integration

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all clients; handles routing, rate-limiting, authentication, etc.
- **Service Mesh / Interface Layer**: Manages service-to-service communication (e.g., Istio, Linkerd)

## Summary

| Feature          | Monolithic           | Microservices                         |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Deployment       | Single unit          | Independent deployments per service   |
| Scalability      | Scale entire app     | Scale only needed services            |
| Development      | Slower for large apps| Parallel development possible         |
| Technology Stack | Unified              | Heterogeneous                         |
| Communication    | In-process           | API / Events                          |
| Fault Isolation  | Weak                 | Strong                                |
