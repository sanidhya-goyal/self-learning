# Microservice Design Pattern Part 2
SAGA Pattern, Strangler Pattern, CQRS

---

## 1. Strangler Pattern

### Purpose
The Strangler Pattern is used for incrementally refactoring a monolithic application into microservices. Instead of rewriting the entire monolith at once, functionalities are extracted one by one and routed through a common interface.

### Key Concepts
- A central controller or facade is used to route incoming API traffic to either the monolith or newly built microservices.
- Over time, more functionality is moved out of the monolith.
- Once all functionalities are refactored, the monolith can be retired.

### Benefits
- Minimizes risk during migration
- Allows partial refactoring and validation
- Reduces downtime

## 2. Saga Pattern

### Purpose
The Saga Pattern manages distributed transactions across multiple microservices where each service has its own database. Traditional ACID transactions are not feasible in such distributed systems.

### Use Case Example
E-commerce order processing involving:
- Order Service
- Inventory Service
- Payment Service

If payment fails, the previous operations (e.g., inventory reservation, order placement) must be compensated.

### Saga Workflow
1. Order Service starts the transaction and publishes an event.
2. Inventory Service listens to the event, updates stock, and emits the next event.
3. Payment Service processes payment. On failure, it emits a failure event.
4. The services listening to failure events perform compensating actions to roll back changes.

### Types of Saga

#### 1. Choreography-Based Saga
- Services communicate via events on a message bus (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- Each service listens to and reacts to events independently.
- No centralized control.

**Drawbacks:**
- Harder to manage as the system grows
- Risk of cyclic dependencies where services indirectly depend on one another through the event chain, complicating error handling and system behavior

#### 2. Orchestration-Based Saga
- A central orchestrator service coordinates the transaction
- The orchestrator calls each participating service in a predefined sequence
- On failure, it explicitly calls compensating actions

## 3. CQRS – Command Query Responsibility Segregation

### Purpose
CQRS separates the read and write responsibilities of data models, especially useful in systems with multiple microservices and separate databases.

### Concepts
- **Command Operations**: Create, Update, Delete
- **Query Operations**: Read-only

### Use Case Example
If two services (S1 and S2) have their own databases, and a join operation is needed between Table T1 (S1) and Table T2 (S2):

- A separate **Read View Database** is created to serve such complex read queries.
- This database contains a denormalized view or projection of the required data from both tables.

### How the Read View is Updated
1. **Event-Driven**: Each service emits an event upon CUD operations, and a separate process listens to these events to update the read model.
2. **Database Trigger / Procedure**: A database-level trigger updates the read view automatically when CUD operations occur in the source databases.

### Benefits
- Optimizes read performance for complex queries
- Reduces coupling between services
- Enables scalability and independence of write and read models

## 4. Database-Per-Service Pattern

### Key Principles
- Each microservice has exclusive access to its own database
- Services interact via APIs or events, never directly with each other’s databases
- Each service can choose the most appropriate type of database (SQL, NoSQL, etc.)

### Benefits
- Better scalability
- Improved service autonomy
- Easier maintenance and evolution

### Challenges
- Joins across databases are not possible directly → resolved via CQRS
- Distributed transactions are difficult → resolved via Saga Pattern

## Interview Scenario: Payment System

### Scenario
Person A pays ₹10 to Person B.

### Services
- **Balance Service**: Manages user account balances
- **Payment Service**: Records and processes payments

### Workflow
1. Balance Service checks if Person A has sufficient balance (e.g., ₹100)
2. Updates balance to ₹90
3. Payment Service attempts to complete the transaction
4. If payment fails:
    - Payment Service emits a failure event
    - Balance Service listens to the event and rolls back the balance to ₹100

This is implemented using a **Saga Pattern**, ensuring consistency across services without distributed transactions.

| Pattern             | Purpose                                 | Benefits                                    | Drawbacks / Considerations                    |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Strangler           | Gradual migration from monolith         | Low risk, smooth transition                 | Requires traffic routing logic                |
| Saga                | Handle distributed transactions         | Ensures data consistency across services    | Complex compensating logic                    |
| CQRS                | Separate reads from writes              | Optimized queries, decoupling of services   | Additional read model and sync mechanisms     |
| Database-per-Service| Service autonomy in data storage        | Scalability, flexibility                    | Joins and transactions are more complex       |
