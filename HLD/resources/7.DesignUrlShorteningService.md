# URL Shortener System Design (e.g. TinyURL, Bitly)

TinyUrl stores the short url and long url in DB
POST the long url and GET the shortened url

Design
### 1. Requirements Analysis

#### a. Short URL Length

- As much as we want, let's compute the length in later section

#### b. Traffic Estimation

- **10 million** URLs per day --> 3650M urls / year
- ~3.65 billion URLs/year
- For 100 years → **365 billion URLs**
(~ 365000M url / year (Total 9 zeros))

#### c. Character Set

- Total usable characters = 10 (0–9) + 26 (a–z) + 26 (A–Z) = **62 characters**

**Combinations per length:**

1 Character     _  --> 62 characters possible\
2 Characters   __  --> 62^2 different combinations possible\
3 Characters  ___  --> 62^3 different combinations possible\
.\
.


- 62¹ = 62
- 62² = 3,844
- 62³ = 238,328
- 62⁶ ≈ 56.8 billion
- 62⁷ ≈ 3.5 trillion ✅

→ So, **7-character URL** supports up to **3.5 trillion** unique short URLs.

### 2. Hash Generation Techniques

#### Option 1: Hash Functions (MD5, SHA)

- **MD5**:
    - 128-bit = 16 bytes, In Hexadecimal, the base is 16, so we need 4 bits\
    1 Byte = 8 bit = 2 Hexadigit\
    So for 16 Bytes = 32 Hexadigits\
    
    Which means MD5 with 128 bit will generate 32 characters.
    And we only need 7 characters for our url.
- **SHA-1**:
    - 160-bit = 20 bytes = 40 hexadecimal characters

To generate short URL:
- Can truncate to first 7 characters.
- But truncating increases risk of **hash collisions**.

### Option 2: Base62 Encoding

- Convert sequential unique ID into Base62 (0–9, a–z, A–Z).
- Example: Convert decimal `1000` to Base62

How to convert it?
Divide the number with 62 and take the remainder
```
1000 ÷ 62 = 16, remainder = 8
16 ÷ 62 = 0, remainder = 16

62 | 1000   8 (remainder)
---------
62 | 16    16 (remainder)

→ Reversed: 16 → g, 8 → 8
→ Base62 encoded string: g8
```

- For Id ≤ 3.5 trillion, encoded string ≤ 7 characters
- Add **padding** if string < 7 characters

### 3. Unique ID Generation (Distributed Setup)

#### Option 1: Ticket Server

- It uses 1 DB, it is a centralised auto-increment service.

**Drawback**: Single point of failure

---

#### Option 2: Snowflake

- 64-bit ID composed of:

```
| 1-bit unused | 41-bit timestamp | 10-bit machine ID | 12-bit sequence number |
```

- Timestamp will be unique, and in case if the timestamp is same than machine id will be different. So, 
Guarantees globally unique ID per request 
- Scalable and fast

---

#### Option 3: Apache Zookeeper

- Used for **distributed coordination**, a distributed application can coordinate with each other reliably
- Can allocate **ID ranges** to different worker nodes
- Zookeeper creates a range :
e.g.
```
0 – 1M    (Range 1)
1M – 2M   (Range 2)
.
.
.
```
There are worker threads,
Each thread will be allotted a range
This is how a Unique ID is generated in distributed environment.

Let's assume that the ID generated is 16
Base62 will generate 'g'
But it is not 7 character long, so we will need **Padding**

In total the range we have for 3.5 trillion is\
0 ------> 3.5 Trillion

We will always have Base62 of number / id **_Less Than or equals to_** 7
If it is less than 7 then we will add padding.

- Each worker service generates IDs from its assigned range
- Ensures distributed, unique, collision-free ID generation

### 4. Database Schema

Table: `urls`

| Field       | Type        | Description               |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `id`        | bigint      | Unique numeric ID         |
| `short_url` | varchar(10) | 7-character encoded value |
| `long_url`  | text        | Original full-length URL  |

---

### 5. High-Level Architecture

```
          +-----------------------+
          |      Client/API       |
          +----------+------------+
                     |
          +----------v-----------+
          |    Load Balancer     |
          +----------+-----------+
                     |
      +--------------v---------------+           +-------------------+
      |  Distributed URL Shortener   |<--------->|     Zookeeper     |
      |         Services             |           | (Range Allocation)|
      +--------------+---------------+           +-------------------+
                     |
           +---------v---------+
           |   URL Database    |
           | (ID, short, long) |
           +-------------------+
```

### 6. Flow Overview

1. Client sends `POST /shorten` with original long URL.
2. Request hits **Load Balancer**, routed to one of the **TinyURL Services**.
3. TinyURL service:
  - Requests ID range or unique ID from **Zookeeper**
  - Encodes ID using **Base62**
  - Stores mapping of `{ID, short_url, long_url}` in **Database**
4. Returns short URL (e.g. `tinyurl.com/g8AbC2X`)
5. On access, `GET /g8AbC2X`:
  - Lookup in DB → redirect to original long URL
