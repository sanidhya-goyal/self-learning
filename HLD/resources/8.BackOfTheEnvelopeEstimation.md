# Back of the Envelope Estimation – System Design

## Purpose

"Back of the Envelope" estimations are **quick, rough calculations** used in system design interviews to:

- Estimate **scale, capacity, and resources**
- Justify **design decisions**
- Evaluate **feasibility and trade-offs**

### Considerations

- Keep values **approximate**, like T-shirt sizing.
- Do not over-optimize or over-calculate (Spend less time)
- Use **simplified, rounded assumptions** (e.g., 10M, 100M).

## Useful Conversion Cheat Sheet

| Unit            | Traffic | Storage |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| 10³ (3 zeroes)  | Thousand | KB |
| 10⁶ (6 zeroes)  | Million  | MB |
| 10⁹ (9 zeroes)  | Billion  | GB |
| 10¹²(12 zeroes) | Trillion | TB |
| 10¹⁵(15 zeroes) | Quadrillion | PB |

### Data Sizes

| Data Type         | Size        |
|------------------|-------------|
| ASCII character   | 1 Byte      |
| Unicode character | 2 Bytes     |
| Long double       | 8 Bytes     |
| Image             | ~300 KB     |

### We compute 4 things :

1. Number of servers
2. RAM required
3. Storage required
4. System trade-offs (CAP theorem)


### Estimation Formula

```
X million users         *       Y MB        =       XY TB
(6 Zeroes)                  (6 Zeroes)            (12 Zeroes)
```

**Example**  
5 million users * 2 KB = 10 GB

## Facebook: Back of the Envelope Estimation

### 1. Traffic Estimation

Assume
- **Total Users**: 1 Billion
- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: 25% = 250 Million user
- **Read / Write Operation**:
    - Assume each user is. doing 5 reads and 2 writes = 7 queries/day

**Total Queries per Day**  
```
250M Users (DAU) * 7 Queries

60 * 60 * 24 = ~ 86,400 seconds are there in a day
For our assumption let's conside 1,00,000 seconds

FOr 250 Million * 7 queries / 100000
= 18K query per second
```

---

### 2. Storage Estimation

#### Posts

Assume :
- Each user posts **2 posts/day**
- Each post = 250 characters = ~500 bytes
- 2 posts = 1000 Bytes ~ 1 KB per user

**Total per day:**

```
250M Users * 1 KB = 250 GB/day for the posts
6 Zeeos     3 Zeroes
```

**Assume, we need to store the data for 5 years ~ 1825 days (Assume 2000 days for simplified calculation):**

```
2000 * 250 GB = 5,00,000 GB = 500 TB for posts
```

---

### Images

- 10% users upload 1 image/day
- Image size = 300 KB
- 10% of 250M = 25M users

**Total per day:**

```
25 Million * 300 KB = 7,500 GB = ~8 TB/day
6 Zeroes    3 Zeroes
```


**For 5 years (2000 days):**

```
2000 * 8 TB = 16,000 TB = 16 PB
```

---

### 3. RAM Estimation

Assume :
- Cache last **5 posts/user**
- 1 post = 500 Bytes → 5 posts = 2,500 Bytes (~3 KB)

**Total for DAU (250M users):**

```
250M (DAU) * 2500 Bytes (~ 3 KB) = 750 GB
6 Zeroes        3 Zeroes
```

**Assume 1 server can cache 75 GB**

→ **10 servers required for caching**

---

### 4. Server Estimation (for handling requests)

- 95% of requests served within **500 ms**\
Example - 
18K requests per User\
Also 1 second has 2 500 ms

- Assume 1 server has 50 threads ⇒ can serve 100 req/sec

**To handle 18,000 QPS:**

```
18000 / 100 = 180 servers
```
---

### 5. CAP Trade-off

- In large-scale distributed systems, **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance** cannot all be achieved simultaneously.
- For Facebook-like systems:
    - **Drop Consistency**
    - Prioritize **Availability** and **Partition Tolerance**
