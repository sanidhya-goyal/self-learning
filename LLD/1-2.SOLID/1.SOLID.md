# SOLID

## SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY Principle
![SOLID3.png](resources/SOLID3.png)
![SOLID4.png](resources/SOLID4.png)

Invoice **"has a"** Marker

- There are multiple changes that can occur in same class, let's assume
changes in calculation logic, changes in printing logic, adding a feature to save to file as well along with DB.

So, now let's break down this as - 


![SOLID5.png](resources/SOLID5.png)

- This is just having calculation logic

![SOLID6.png](resources/SOLID6.png)

- A separate class for saving to DB

![SOLID7.png](resources/SOLID7.png)

- Another one to print the Invoice

------
## OPEN / CLOSED Principle

![SOLID8.png](resources/SOLID8.png)
![SOLID9.png](resources/SOLID9.png)

- To add a new functionality of "save to file", we wrote some code directly in DAO
But this is not the right way

![SOLID10.png](resources/SOLID10.png)

## LISKOV Substitution

![SOLID11.png](resources/SOLID11.png)

```
interface Bike {
    void turnOnEngine();
    void accelerate();
}

class MotorCycle implements Bike {

    boolean isEngineOn;
    int speed;
    
    public void turnOnEngine() {
        // turn on the engine!
        isEngineOn = true;
    }
    
    public void accelerate() {
        // increase the speed
        speed = speed + 10; 
    }
}

class Bicycle implements Bike {

    public void turnOnEngine() {
        throw new AssertionError ("there is no engine");
    }
    public void accelerate () {
        //do something
    }
}

}

```

Here, the functionality is narrowed down, the Bike's functionality "turn on the engine" doesn't exist in Bicycle

-----

## INTERFACE SEGMENTED Principle

![SOLID14.png](resources/SOLID14.png)

The interface RestaurantEmployee has many functionalities like

- washDishes
- serverCustomers
- cookFood

![SOLID15.png](resources/SOLID15.png)

The waiter class has to unnecessary implement all these methods.\
Waiter only has "serveCustomers" functionality.

![SOLID16.png](resources/SOLID16.png)

--------

## DEPENDENCY INVERSION

![SOLID17.png](resources/SOLID17.png)
![SOLID18.png](resources/SOLID18.png)

We have concrete class objects here, which is violating Dependency Inversion principle,

So instead we should take interfaces "Mouse" and "Keyboard"
![SOLID19.png](resources/SOLID19.png)

we can pass WiredKeyboard or BluetoothKeyboard in constructor now

## 1.1 Liskov Principle 

If you substitute the Child or Parent Object, the program should not break

e.g. 

```

Parent parentObj = new Child1();

Parent parentObj = new Child2();
Parent parentObj = new Child3();
.
.
.
```

![LISKOV1.png](resources/LISKOV1.png)
![LISKOV2.png](resources/LISKOV2.png)

Here the Output will be `true` for both the prints

Now what is the problem here - 

![LISKOV3.png](resources/LISKOV3.png)

![LISKOV4.png](resources/LISKOV4.png)

This will throw NullPointerException, which shows that the child has narrowed down the functionality of parent

So in parent, put only generic method which are common for all


![LISKOV5.png](resources/LISKOV5.png)
![LISKOV6.png](resources/LISKOV6.png)
![LISKOV7.png](resources/LISKOV7.png)
- WithoutStrategyPattern.Vehicle only have the getNumberOfWheels now


![LISKOV8.png](resources/LISKOV8.png)

- Bicycle gives error as the EngineVehicle is being referenced by Motorcycle and Car only.

![LISKOV9.png](resources/LISKOV9.png)

Similarly the Vehice dont have "hasEngine"
